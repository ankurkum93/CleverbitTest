# CleverbitTest
The data used for this report is attached and called realdata.xlsx
I have cleaned the data using Power BI transformation.
While cleaning, I removed the prices which were in negative assuming one cannot be charged negative for a product.

wherein I have removed few columns namely Pickup and dropoff as they were lats and longs concatenated and we didn't need that.
I have also created multiple columns like date, dayotw, timeinhour, TownCount,
TripDuration, Sales, Demand,Revenue.

The first sheet contains Dashboard which is a comprehensive view 
and it is followed by multiple reports which is more of a detailed view.

I have tried to answer every question that was asked in the test and 1 of them could not be answered due to lack of time.

I have displayed metrics like Avg trip duration and 
answered the most hectic hours in a week.
Also, what will happen if we give the discount at certain times.
Things like most common routes are displayed along with the number of times they appear.
Daily trips is also important when it comes to analyse the big picture
